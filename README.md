## Automation Project Description
This project automates the API testing of Pet Store API v3. For acomlishing this I used Java, Cucumber and Rest-Assured.
Automated test cases cover the critical functionalities separated by Pet API, User API and Store API. Pet Store API documentation can be found in https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore

### Tools and Technologies
- **Java**: Version 21
- **Cucumber**: Version 7.14.0
- **Maven**: For building and dependecy management.
- **Rest-Assured**: Version 5.3.0

---
### Features
- Positive and Negative test cases for User API, Pet API and Store API.
- Uses Cucumber for a BDD with human readable test scenarios.
- Uses Java for implementing scenarios in step definition classes.
- Uses predefined JSON schemas for validating response structures.
- Supports parallel execution of test cases for faster feedback.

---
### Automation Project Setup and Requirements
#### Prerequisites
- **Java 21**: Download and install Java 21 from Oracle website https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html or use OpenJDK.
- **Maven**: Download and install Maven from oficcial site https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

#### Steps to build
- Download and extract this project, or clone it using git.
- Open terminal, console or cmd and navigate to project folder `PetStoreAutomation/PetStoreAutomation`.
- Build the project: 
```bash
mvn clean install
```

---
### Project Execution
There are two profiles available: 
- **`local`**: Points to the localhost instance of the Pet Store API.
- **`prod`**: Points to the hosted version of Pet Store API v3.

#### Execution Commands
##### Run All Tests
```bash
mvn clean test -Pprod
```

##### Run a Specific Feature by Tag
```bash
mvn clean test -Pprod -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@petAPI"
```
> **_Valid Tags:_** `petAPI`, `userAPI`, `storeAPI`

##### Run Multiple Features by Tag
```bash
mvn clean test -Pprod "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@storeAPI or @userAPI"
```
> **_Valid Tags:_** `petAPI`, `userAPI`, `storeAPI`

##### Run Tests in Parallel
```bash
mvn clean test -Pprod -DthreadCount=4
```

##### Run Tests with Mixed Options
```bash
mvn clean test -Pprod -DthreadCount=4 "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@storeAPI or @userAPI"
```

#### View Reports
- **HTML** and **JSON** reports are generated in the `target/reports` folder.
- Open the `cucumber-reports.html` file in a web browser.

## Performance Test

### Load Test:
* Measures system behaviour with a predefined number of concurrent users/transactions on stipulated time.

### Stress Test:
* Test system limits by increasing requests/load gradually until failing.

### Indicators:
1. Response time.
2. Error rate.
3. Processed request per second.
4. System/resource utilization.

#### Indicators Importance:
1. Gives important data about system reliability.
2. Gives an understanding of how user experience is going to perfom based on response times.
3. Gives important data for a better resource planing which also impacts the system cost.

## Performance Project Description
This project focuses on performance testing a RESTful API for the PetStore v3 API. The goal is to validate the applicationâ€™s reliability and responsiveness under various load and stress scenarios.

### Tools and Technologies
- **K6**: Open-source loadtesting tool used to write and execute performance tests.
- **k6-reporter**: K6 extension to generate a visual HTML report.

### Test Scenarios
**1. Load Test** : Its purpose is to evaluate the system performance under a consistent load.
- Configuration: 
    * 20 Virtual users.
    * 2m Duration.

- Executor: constant-vus.

**2. Stress Test** : Its purpose is to evaluate the system's behaviour under gradually increasing the load to identify beaking points

- Configuration: 
    * Start with 0 Virtual Users (VUs).
    * Ramp up to 50 VUs in 1m.
    * Sustain 100 VUs for 2m.
    * Ramp down to 0 VUs in 1m.

- Executor: ramping-vus.

### Test Workflow
1. **Login**: call API **GET /user/login** to simulate user login.
2. **Get Pets by Status**: call API **GET /pet/findByStatus?status=available** to simulate a home page grid load of available pets.
3. **Create a Pet**: call API **POST /pet** to create a new pet with a random ID.
4. **Get Pet by ID**: call API **GET /pet/{id}** to simulate loading the newly created pet.
